## Moving Average Tool Details

A simple tool to be used for calculate moving averages for a given dataset.
This tool plots both the original timeseries dataset as well as the moving average for the data
in a single plot.


## Using the Tool

The first step is to get some data. There are many methods to download historical stock data.
You can refer to some of them here.

Once you have your data, create a csv file with only the date and the ending stock quote
for any stock or index.


Now you are ready to create the moving average!


Upload the CSV file you had created earlier.
You can select the moving average window( in number of days ) as the second input parameter.
As you change the second parameter, the corresponding moving average changes dynamically.
